# ADMHomeworks2nd

The file named 'ADM HW2nd.ipynb' contains the codes and solutions to 8 practical questions and 3 theoretical questions. 

We analysed the Steam Reviews 2021 data and answered research questions (RQs) that may help them discover and interpret meaningful patterns in data and eventually understand what a user looks for in a video game. 

To answer the questions here we combined all the three datasets into one single file named 'stream_reviews_combined.csv' which can be found at this link 'https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XDbHu9qGDDOJUZpTQCEMocCeyXyqlJTP/view?usp=sharing'
